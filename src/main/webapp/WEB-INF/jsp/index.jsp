            <p>
                The Next Generation in Communication

                2U aims to create an ecosystem of integrated products and services, paving the way to the next major
                technological advancement. To kick things of, we have launched 2U Chat, an innovative, feature packed
                messaging app that prepares you for the future of communication.

                Featuring built-in text and voice over translation, high quality video, secure encryption and much more,
                2U Chat equips the modern person to communicate socially and professionally with ease. For example, you
                may now create groups to message, call or video chat with whilst utilising our voice over translations
                to listen in any language you choose, regardless of what language your peers may be speaking while
                knowing your conversations are not being overheard with our encryption technology.

                The next step on the roadmap is integrating our smart devices onto the app. We have leading edge AI
                technology, including smart air conditioners, keyless locks and energy towers which harness renewable
                energies to power up individual households. All these new appliances may be controlled, configured and
                monitored through the 2U app. Ultimately, we aim to dismantle the barrier for communication between
                humans and machines, making it as user-friendly and intuitive as possible for everyone to use.

        <p>

            Brighsun New Energy is responsible for all research and development of new energy related projects.
            Currently BNE is undergoing commercialisation of its Li-S battery technology.

            The same Li-S battery material can be applied on any battery-operated devices and machineries such as mobile
            phone, electronic wearables, portable power tools, construction & agricultural machineries, aircraft, marine
            vessels and energy storage units. Future development roadmap will be published in near future. All of which
            will be managed by BNE.

            Below is a list of research, development and credentials of Brighsun New Energy since it established in
            2007.

            2007 - Start to research on Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) battery core material.
            2009 - Start to test Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) battery on long-range bus.
            2010 - Mileage test is conducted on mid-range and long-range buses with an ENEX TestLab Australia under
            commercial operation environment in Hubei. The test buses are loaded with sand bags as substitute for
            passenger weight, air-conditioning switched on and stopped at every bus station. The result of a single
            charge is 480 km for the short-range and 519 km for the long-range.
            2011 - Start to research Lithium Sulphur (Li-S) battery.
            2013 - Apply patent for Cathode material of Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4); start electrolyte research for
            Lithium Sulphur (Li-S) battery.
            2014 - Establish Nanxun Brighsun New Material Co., Ltd and Brighsun Co., Ltd. for Lithium Iron Phosphate
            (LiFePO4) Cathode material and battery’s mass production; continue research for Lithium Sulphur (Li-S)
            battery material and production test.

            Published journal article in Materials Chemistry and Physics – "Controllable growth of LiFePO4 microplates
            of (010) and (001) lattice planes for Li ion batteries: A case of the growth manner on the Li ion diffusion
            coefficient and electrochemical performance"
            2015 - Mass production of short-range and long-range buses with Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) battery.
            The short-range bus reached 800 km for a single charge and the long-range bus reached over 1,000 km for a
            single charge. The long range mode acquired Guinness World Records for single charge greatest distance by
            electric bus (non-solar) later in the year.

            Patent authorisation for Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) Cathode material is granted in the same year. The
            team focuses on Lithium Sulphur (Li-S) battery material research hereafter.

            Published journal article in Materials Research Innovations – "Low-cost synthesis of nanocrystal line and
            spherical LiFePO4/C composite cathode materials"

            Acquired China Patent for Method of manufacturing LiFePO4 cathodic material for lithium secondary batteries
            invention.

            Acquired Guinness World Record Certification – Greatest distance by electric bus, single charge (non-solar)
            is 1,018km (632.55 miles) and was achieved by Brighsun EV Group (Australia) in Melbourne, Australia from
            14th to 15th November 2015

            Published journal article in Material Letters – "Facile synthesis of Ni/Li3Ti4NiCrO12 composites with
            enhanced cycle performance as lithium ion battery anode"
            2016 - Start to research on high energy density stability for Lithium Sulphur (Li-S) battery.
            2017 - Research on separators and separator coatings for Lithium Sulphur (Li-S) batteries.
            2018 - Research on large Lithium Sulphur (Li-S) batteries.
            2019 - Research large Lithium Sulphur (Li-S) batteries in progress.

            Filed Brighsun logo Trademark with IP Australia
            2020 - Filed for "A lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery cathode material synthesized by using silica hollow
            spheres" provisional patent application with IP Australia

            SGS Lab test result has proven a single charge can reach up to 2,000km range according to energy density
            calculation

            Bloomberg news published after latest SGS test report - 21 April 2020

            Start of production line test.

            Filed international patent application for "A lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery cathode material synthesized by
            using silica hollow spheres" with WIPO. PCT International Application No.: PCT/AU2020/051294
